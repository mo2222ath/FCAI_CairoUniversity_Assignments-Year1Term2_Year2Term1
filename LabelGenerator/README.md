# LabelGenerator

For certain applications, it is useful to be able to generate a series of names that form a sequential pattern. For example, if you were writing a program to number figures in a paper, having some mechanism to return the sequence of strings "Figure 1", "Figure 2", "Figure 3", and so on, would be very handy. However, you might also need to label points in a geometric diagram, in which case you would want a similar but independent set of labels for points such as "P0", "P1", "P2", and so forth. If you think about this problem more generally, the tool you need is a label generator that allows the client to define arbitrary sequences of labels, each of which consists of a prefix string ("Figure " or "P" for the examples in the preceding paragraph) coupled with an integer used as a sequence number. Because the client may want different sequences to be active simultaneously, it makes sense to define the label generator as an abstract type called LabelGenerator. To initialize a new generator, the client provides the prefix string and the initial index as arguments to the LabelGenerator constructor. Once the generator has been created, the client can return new labels in the sequence by calling nextLabel on the LabelGenerator.
