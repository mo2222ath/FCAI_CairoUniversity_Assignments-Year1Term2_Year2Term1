# One line memory game

One line memory game. In this game, 10 characters are chosen. Each character is repeated twice. The characters are put in random order. Each player picks two numbers between 1 and 20. The two characters in these positions are shown and the rest are covered with their position number. If the two characters match, the player wins a point and these two characters are covered with * from now on. The screen is cleared and the remaining character positions are displayed for the next player. When all characters are covered with *, the game ends and the player with the biggest score wins.
